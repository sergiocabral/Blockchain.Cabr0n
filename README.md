GoHorse is a Git-based blockchain.

Frai said: *"Cabr0n Coin is the future"*
(because it simply does not yet exist in the present)

By the way, the name has changed! You noticed that, right?

## The Project

The development is being led by [Sergio Cabral](https://github.com/sergiocabral).

The language used is TypeScript with NodeJS.

The project was conceived during a live on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/sergiocabral_com) while talking about Git. If Git commits as a blockchain, why not make a Git-based blockchain?

Development began on May 31, 2021. During the process, source code versions were being dropped into branches prefixed with `deprecated`. Main branches are prefixed with `app` for applications and `npm` for libraries used by the applications.

The `main` branch is not intended for development. Possibly it will only have documentation.

Blockchains will use branches prefixed with `blockchain`.

## First block (or commit)

The first block of the blockcahin is [b0709bfb082a55f59f4daaa111592f7636dd3dac](https://github.com/sergiocabral/Blockchain.GoHorse/commit/b0709bfb082a55f59f4daaa111592f7636dd3dac) registered on a Monday, on the 24th of May 2021 at 13:22:36 UTC-3.

But the email from the comitter (git@sergiocabral.com) did not match the email from the GPG key E6B84D1173C89697 (twitch@sergiocabral.com), resulting in GitHub not applying the 'verified commit' stamp. Thus, the original first block was deprecated by a `commit --amend` resulting in another block that will be used as the First: [e660878252bd7fa386ceadf59c22d7fb5efb991e](https://github.com/sergiocabral/Blockchain.GoHorse/commit/e660878252bd7fa386ceadf59c22d7fb5efb991e)
