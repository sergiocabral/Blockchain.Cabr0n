Chat commands should always start with one of the options below. Use what more like:

> !cc
> !cabron
> !cabroncoin
> !cabr0ncoin
> !cabronc0in
> !cabr0nc0in

Here are the features and their possible commands.
Less than and greater than < > indicate mandatory parameter.
Brackets [ ] indicate optional parameter.
Values containing spaces must be enclosed in double quotation marks.

# Help
  Display the link to access this help file.

> !cc ? "[language]"
> !cc -h "[language]"
> !cc --help "[language]"

  [language] : Currently available "pt-BR" and "en-US", which can be referenced just as "pt" and "en", respectively.

# Wallet
  Register the wallet on the blockchain.
  Wallets are automatically created when needed. So, this command is not that useful.

> !cc -wn
> !cc --wallet --new

# User profile
  Register a status phrase for the blockchain user profile.

> !cc -p "[status-message]"
> !cc --profile "[status-message]"

  [status-message] : If not informed, it will use the standard blockchain phrase.
